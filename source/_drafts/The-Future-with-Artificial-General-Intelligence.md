<!-- A sketch of a likely future. -->

The development of artificial intelligence (AI) went toe-to-toe with the understanding of the human brain and intelligence in general.
In the early years of 21th centry, we built AI systems that could sense and reflex like humans.
based on our understanding of the human visual system.
These systems could see as well as we do, if not better.
NLP, then robotics

Scaling up these system would not yield a qualitative change as we soon realized.

<!-- Media dodges the problem by  claiming these systems were in lack of "souls". -->

Around the same time, some scientists proposed a different approach to understand intelligence.
According to their theory, intelligence of a sub-system is the ability of that sub-system to maintain low entropy in the whole system.
We learned that intelligence is purely metaphysical, and the physical substrate where it has most control over determines its strength.
Arbitrary boundry, both spatially and temporally, could be drawn to enclose a subset of laws of physics so that intelligence could be measured.
Though the theory provides a mean to measure intelligence, such measurements could not be done on non-trivial cases.
Nonetheless, the theory provided a new perspective to analyze intelligent entities and intelligent behaviors.


<!-- However, the total intelligence by definition remains fixed, so any intelligent entity would  -->

Media hyped this new theory with the title: "Scientists say souls exist, and our souls control our bodies!"



We would say 

Like any other science debates in the history, on the cutting edge of science awaits philosophy.
This time, 


These scientists re-designed the problem formulations long used in the AI community, and decomposed what commonly considered as


Brain-computer interface (BCI) had years of steady progress until the invention of Quantum Chamber changes the landscape of the whole field.
Previously, invasive BCIs that deploy physical devices into human brain has been the only reliable way of reading and writing brain signals.
Non-invasive BCIs could only read brain signals with less fidelity and failed compeletely to write brain signals.
A group of neuroscientist and physicists designed Quantum Chamber that later became THE solution of BCI.
Quantum Chamber utilized latest physics advance at the time to control the quantum entanglement of particals inside and outside of the brain.
This allowed this method to both read and write brain signals with band-width magnitudes above previous methods.
